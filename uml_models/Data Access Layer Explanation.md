The Data Access Layer in the Cardiovascular Health Monitoring System (CHMS) is responsible for interfacing with various external data sources and transforming raw input into structured patient data. At the core of this subsystem is the DataListener abstraction, which defines a standard interface for listening to incoming data streams. This design allows for multiple specialized listeners, such as FileDataListener, TCPDataListener, and WebSocketDataListener, each tailored to handle data from different sources like files, TCP sockets, or WebSocket connections. By inheriting from the DataListener base class, these subclasses ensure that the system can easily accommodate new data input methods in the future without disrupting the overall architecture.
Once data is received by a listener, it is passed to the DataSourceAdapter, which acts as a bridge between the raw data input and the rest of the system. The DataSourceAdapter relies on a DataParser component to interpret the raw data string and convert it into a structured PatientData object. This separation of concerns ensures that parsing logic is decoupled from data acquisition, making the system more modular and maintainable. The DataParser encapsulates the logic for handling different data formats, such as JSON or CSV, and provides a consistent interface for extracting patient information. Overall, this design enables the CHMS to flexibly and reliably ingest data from a variety of sources, supporting real-time monitoring and future extensibility.
