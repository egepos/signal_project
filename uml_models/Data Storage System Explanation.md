The Data Storage System in the Cardiovascular Health Monitoring System (CHMS) is designed to securely store, organize, and manage all incoming patient data. At the center of this subsystem is the DataStorage class, which maintains a map of patient records and provides methods for storing new data, deleting outdated entries, and retrieving patient-specific information. Each piece of data is encapsulated in a PatientData object, which records the patientâ€™s ID, the type of vital sign, its value, and a timestamp. This structure ensures that every data point is both traceable and easy to query for historical analysis or real-time monitoring.
To facilitate efficient data retrieval, the DataRetriever class is associated with DataStorage and offers methods for querying records by patient ID or by specific time ranges. This allows medical staff to quickly access relevant data for a given patient or period, supporting both clinical decision-making and trend analysis. Security and privacy are addressed through the AccessControl class, which manages user roles and enforces access policies. Before any data is accessed, the system checks whether the requesting user has the appropriate permissions, ensuring that sensitive patient information is only available to authorized personnel.
Overall, this design emphasizes modularity, security, and scalability. By separating data storage, retrieval, and access control, the system can be easily extended to support new data types, retrieval methods, or security requirements. The clear structure also supports compliance with healthcare data regulations, making the CHMS robust and trustworthy for use in real-world hospital environments.
