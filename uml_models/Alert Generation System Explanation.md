The Alert Generation System in the Cardiovascular Health Monitoring System (CHMS) is designed to continuously monitor patient vital signs and ensure timely intervention when critical conditions arise. At the heart of this subsystem is the AlertGenerator class, which is responsible for evaluating incoming patient data against a set of personalized threshold rules. These rules, encapsulated by the ThresholdRule class, define the specific conditions under which an alert should be triggered for each type of vital sign, such as heart rate or blood pressure. When new data arrives, the AlertGenerator consults the relevant ThresholdRule to determine if the value violates the patient’s safety threshold. If a violation is detected, the system creates an Alert object containing the patient’s ID, a description of the condition, and a timestamp marking when the alert was triggered.
Once an alert is generated, it is handed off to the AlertManager, which is responsible for dispatching the alert to the appropriate medical staff. The AlertManager maintains a list of staff members and ensures that each alert reaches the right personnel for a timely response. This separation of responsibilities—where the AlertGenerator focuses on data evaluation and alert creation, and the AlertManager handles notification—ensures that the system is both modular and maintainable. The use of the ThresholdRule class allows for flexible and individualized alert criteria, making it easy to adapt the system to different patients’ needs. Overall, this design supports extensibility, clarity, and robust operation in a safety-critical healthcare environment, ensuring that every alert is both meaningful and actionable.
