The Patient Identification System is the part of the CHMS that makes sure every piece of data is matched to the right person,no mix-ups allowed. At the center of this system is the IdentityManager, which keeps a list of all known patients in the hospital. When new data comes in, the IdentityManager is responsible for finding the correct patient record. It does this by using the PatientIdentifier, a helper class that specializes in matching incoming patient IDs to the official hospital records.
Each patient is represented by the HospitalPatient class, which stores important details like the patient’s ID, name, and medical history. If the system ever encounters a patient ID it doesn’t recognize, the IdentityManager can handle these mismatches gracefully, ensuring that no data is lost or misattributed. The relationships in the diagram show how these classes work together: the IdentityManager aggregates a list of HospitalPatient objects, and relies on the PatientIdentifier to perform the actual matching. This design keeps the process organized and reliable, so that every data point is always linked to the right patient, supporting both patient safety and data integrit
